# Sleeping-Barber-Problem-OS-Kernel-Implementation

Introduction: 
Sleeping Barber problem is a classical process synchronization problem. The 
context of the problem is as follows: The barber shop has one barber, one barber 
chair, and n (3 in our case) chairs for waiting customers to sit on. If there are no 
customers present, the barber sits down in the barber chair and falls asleep. 
When a customer arrives, he has to wake up the sleeping barber. If additional 
customers arrive while the barber is cutting a customer's hair, they either sit 
down (if there are empty chairs) or leave the shop (if all chairs are full). The 
problem is to program the barber and the customers without getting into race 
conditions.
